Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Solution

Using Proportional(P), Integral(I) and Differential(D) parameters in a PID controller greatly contributed to stabilizing the steering angle of the car.

PID, being a control loop feedback mechanism, receives the current cross-track error from the simulator and uses the three mentioned parameters to update the car's steering angle, where:

- Proportional (P) coefficient provides a steering angle proportional to the current cross-track error. Usage of P causes the car to stay as close as possible to the region where the cross-track error would be zero.
- Integral (I) coefficient uses accumulated cross-track error to determine the steering angle. By accumulating the errors, it provides a mechanism to correct the steering angle in case there is a mismatch between intended and actual steering angles.
- Differential (D) coefficient mitigates the overshooting issue caused by usage of the P-controller which results in the oscillation that builds up over time.

The final hyperparameters were chosen and adjusted through manual tuning where I started with the proportional constant of value 0.1.
This value proved to be a good start that allowed the car to drive "safely" around the track with some oscillation which was growing as I was increasing the throttle. 
The oscillation was mitigated by using and fine tuning the differential component.

Changes to the Integral coefficient proved to have much low impact on the stable drive around the track compared to other two parameters.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
